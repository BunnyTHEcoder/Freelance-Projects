Promoted car model stack /// 
Write a class to keep track of the monthly promoted models and their prices with a stack data structure. The
class needs to support:
1) Pushing the latest promoted model onto the stack.
2) Popping the latest promoted model off the stack.
3) Peeking the latest promoted model at the top of the stack (without popping).
4) Getting the lowest priced model and highest priced model among the past promoted models.
